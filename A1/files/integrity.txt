"Dalhousie University defines plagiarism as 'the submission or presentation of the work of another as if it were one's own.'"
"Plagiarism is a serious academic offence. A finding of plagiarism may result in a failing grade of an assignment or course or, if very serious, suspension or expulsion from the university. In fact, if plagiarism is discovered after a student has completed his or her studies, and the penalty results in that student no longer meeting the requirements of a degree that has been awarded, the university may rescind that degree."
